# 4-bit Counter in Verilog

## 📌 Overview
This is a simple 4-bit synchronous counter designed in Verilog.  
It increments on every positive edge of the clock.

## 🧠 Features
- 4-bit output  
- Active-high reset  
- Increments from 0 to 15  

## 📂 Files
- `counter.v` – Counter RTL code  
- `counter_tb.v` – Testbench  

## 🛠 Tools Used
ModelSim / Vivado / EDA Playground

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Sequential logic  
- Flip-flop based counters  
- Clock and reset handling
